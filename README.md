# Vjudge-Assistant
I try to improve my weak English by wirting this page.

This simple script is my first tool published on the Internet.It offers you the button which helps you copy the sample input or output easily ~and improve your rate of AC~ when you solve the algorithm problem on vjudge.net.

If you want to use this script,please ensure you have installed **TamperMonkey** at first.

The Button could run properly (may be) on the problem page's source is:
ZOJ,POJ,HDU,CodeForces,计蒜客 and so on?
